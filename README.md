# Project Motivationï¼š
Using gpt4 based model. come up with a new service that can integrate with the current hiring process. To address the pain point, such as, 
1. Need to deal with a lot of talents (job seekers)
2. Many Job positions everyday from different job sites (linkedin, indeed, glassdoor and many more)
3. The response rate for job seekers are low in general
The sidenote is that hiring agency needs to have both quality and quantity of hired talents to claim some profit from the employer. Our job is try to make their life easier and more profit.
